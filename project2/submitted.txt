Scene:
I replaced the house and the tree with a road, featuring two cars. The sliders now control the cars' positiions in the stage.

Recursive:
I implemented a Sierpinski triangle pretty much standardly.

Still life:
Also a pretty unremarkable implementation. Just plopped my 3-d objects on the table.

Animation:
I wish I had more time to work on this and the still life - I got sick, and have just been out of it the last few days. Anyway this was supposed to/going to be a piston rotating on a flywheel, but I'm out of time to get it to any point where I'm satisfied with it. You mentioned a couple of times in class working on things already turned in to polish them up - I was wondering if I could do something of the sort with this assignment. I'm turning it in as-is though, as you've said is best practice.
