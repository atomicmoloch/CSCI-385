I in theory have everything working, including flapping; however, for some reason (I have tried to figure out why) my sheet constantly pulls to the left.
I think my constrain code must be at fault for this simply out of a process of elimination of other factors, but I don't know how.

I think gravity may not be string enough; the sheet will never 'even out' after being flapped or blown.

Of note, if you want to cause a large flap, you can pause the simulation, hit the flap button as many times as is desired, and then unpause it.
